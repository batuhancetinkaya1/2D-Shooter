## Boost System
The game includes various boosts to assist the player during gameplay. Below is a list of available boosts and their effects:

1. **Speed Boost**:
   - Increases the player's movement speed for a limited time.
   - Useful for dodging enemies or repositioning quickly.

2. **Bullet Speed Boost**:
   - Increases the speed of the bullets fired by the player.
   - Ideal for hitting fast-moving enemies or targets at a distance.

3. **Bullet Rate Boost**:
   - Reduces the time between consecutive shots.
   - Enhances the player's firepower in intense situations.

4. **Health Recovery**:
   - Restores a portion of the player's health.
